        <p class="lead"> Geometric deep learning has important applications in the fields of quantum computing, 3D perception, molecular designs, and the discovery of mathematical theorems. It takes account of properties such as invariance and equivariance. Many existing structure-aware deep networks lack rigorous theoretical foundations of desired properties in modelling, such as network stability, interpretability, and efficient computation. This workshop will gather researchers from mathematics and computer sciences to provide a forum to establish diverse mathematical theories for geometric deep learning, such as harmonic analysis, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, differential geometry, differential equations, graph theory, approximation theory, statistics, and theoretical computer science. </p>

        <p> <b>SCHEDULE</b> MLSB will begin at 8:30am CST and end at 5:00pm CST on Saturday, Dec 3. The physical workshop will take place in Room 288 - 289 in the New Orleans Convention Center. The schedule of talks and poster sessions is available at our website, mlsb.io and on the <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/50005">NeurIPS website</a>. </p>
        <p> <b>PANEL</b> -
          We will be hosting a panel discussion including our invited speakers on research directions in Machine Learning for Structural Biology from 2:50-3:50p CST. We are soliciting additional discussion topics and questions -- let us know what you would like to hear about by filling out this google form: <a href="https://forms.gle/fiJ6ZzsmepKL87tMA">https://forms.gle/fiJ6ZzsmepKL87tMA</a>. </p>
        <p> <b>POSTER SESSIONS</b> -
          We have scheduled two poster sessions at 11:15-12:15pm CST and 3:50-4:50pm CST. Posters can be set up before the conference begins, between 8:00-8:30am, during the break between 9:45-10:05am, or at the beginning of the first poster session.

          We ask that posters are 24"W x 36"H, as there may be space constraints in the room that limit the display of wider posters. However, if you already have a poster of a different size, it is acceptable to use that. </p>
        <p> <b>LUNCH + HAPPY HOUR</b> -
          MLSB will be providing boxed lunches to attendees during the workshop. In addition, there will be a happy hour during the afternoon poster session, where drinks will be served (non-alcoholic options will be available). </p>
        <p> <b>ORALS</b> -
          Each oral will have a 15 minute timeslot. We anticipate that talks should last approximately 10 minutes, allowing 5 minutes for questions and transition between speakers. If you are presenting in-person, you may check slides before the workshop (8:00-8:30am CST) or during the break (9:45-10:05am CST). </p>
        <p> Please check the schedule on our website, mlsb.io, for your presentation time. If you are not able to make this time, let us know as soon as possible. Additionally, below we have listed the format we currently have for each oral presentation (In-person, Live over Zoom, or Prerecorded). If this information is not correct, please let us know. You can contact us at workshopmlsb@gmail.com with any issues. </p>
        <p> <b>VIRTUAL PARTICIPATION</b> -
          MLSB will have some hybrid elements. There will be a livestream (a link is available at the <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/50005">NeurIPS website</a>. Chat will be available on the NeurIPS workshop site for asking questions.

          Currently, there is no official venue for presenting posters virtually at MLSB. However, we are considering options to enable greater virtual participation over the next few days. If you have a poster at MLSB but plan to participate only virtually, please let us know by adding your name to this <a href="https://forms.gle/ntQDsULXaVkzVXYR8">google form</a> as soon as possible. </p> -->

Recently, he started to undertake work in Theoretical Machine Learning, in order to exploit its tools to understand String Theory as a problem in big data. As a Rhodes Scholar he has pursued his passion in understanding fundamental physical processes by undertaking doctoral work in String Theory at the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford. During his recently completed thesis, he worked on understanding various aspects of complex geometries that feature in String Theory, using the tools of differential and algebraic-geometry. Prior to this, Challenger completed his undergraduate work in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata. During his undergraduate years, he worked on a NASA-sponsored project applying stochastic optimisation techniques to analyse data from the proposed gravitaional wave detector, LISA. When he isn‚Äôt tied up in stringy or machine learning affairs, he likes to show off his constantly diminishing skills in table tennis.
